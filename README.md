# My Kaggle Attempts

This repository stores my kaggle notebooks and datasets. I will be updating this repository as I work on more kaggle projects.

## How will I attempt the Projects?

I will typically attempt the projects that are beginner friendly and then move on to more complex datasets. Additionally, I will try to attempt it using the best of my knowledge referencing my own notes, Stack Overflow, googling documentations before looking at other people's notebooks. **Only when I am truly stuck even when looking at other people's notebooks will I then use AI tools for help (ChatGPT/Copilot)**. 

After my attempt, I will note down the accuracy of my models and learn from others as well as online resources to improve my model :).
